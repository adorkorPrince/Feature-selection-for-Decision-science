# Feature-selection-for-Decision-science

****
## Features
1. Simple Data Exploration.

2. Many Preprocessing methods:
     * Sample and Split
     * Data Preprocessing (Missing Values Imputation, label Encoding, Handle Unknown Levels, Fix Imbalance for Classification)
     * Scale and Transform (Normalization, Transformation, Target Transformation)
     * Feature Engineering (Feature Interaction, Polynomial Features, Bin Numeric Features)
     * Feature Selection (Feature Importance, Remove Multicollinearity, Principal Components Analysis, Ignore Variances)
     * Unsupervised (Create Clusters, Remove Outliers)

3. Model Training:
   * Compare all available Machine Learning Algorithm automatically.
   * Train a selected single model
   * Train an ensemble model
   * Hyperparameter tuning for a single model

4. Model Result Visualization:
   * All plots for Regression and Classification
  
5. Prediction and Save Model:
    * Save the whole Machine Learning Pipeline as a pickle file
